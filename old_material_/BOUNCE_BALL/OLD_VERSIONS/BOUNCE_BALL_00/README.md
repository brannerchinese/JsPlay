## Experiment with ball motion.

In Firefox v. 28.0, ball describes a gentle parabola. It is not complete, but it moves attractively.

In Chrome v. 34.0.1847.131, ball seems to vanish upward almost too fast to be seen.

In iCab v. 5.1.1, ball seems to vanish upward almost too fast to be seen.

Can we specify a fixed field of motion and not allow ball to leave that?
