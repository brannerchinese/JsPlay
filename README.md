 1. 20140427: `BOUNCE_BALL`: Make a ball bounce in the browser window. Should load as HTML file: `BOUNCE_BALL/bounce_ball.html`.

 1. 20130608: `ROTATE_TEXT`: Rotate horizontal text to vertical and vice versa â€” this is intended for use with Chinese poetry and so is formatted in an HTML table. Try running here:
